demo running live on:
[graphical interface now](https://osmiogrzesznik.github.io/HtmlTools/inconsistencyCheck.html)
##What it does:

prints out the trumpf g-code on canvas (WIP) 
Intended only to use with blank cutting
detects profiles, regularities in nesting to mark inconsitencies(outside cut before inside cut)
allows crude block selection, editing and analysing TruTops generated files
for faster identification of dangers or quick block-level edit that doesnt require firing often slow 3d software for quick fix.



##TODO:
  correctly draw TC_RECT2 (rotation parameter R)
  implement drawing and bbox for TC_OBLONG2 etc
